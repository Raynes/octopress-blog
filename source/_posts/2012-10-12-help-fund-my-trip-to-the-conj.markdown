!!! GOAL REACHED! WOOHOO! LOOK FOR A FOLLOW-UP BLOG POST SOON WITH A LIST OF
-DONORS !!!

Hello there boys and girls of all ages, shapes, and sizes. It's your old friend
Anthony Grimes (Raynes) here with an appeal.

You see, I didn't plan on going to the [Clojure Conj](http://clojure-conj.org) 
conference this year. A sad decision it was, I knew I wouldn't be able to pay
for a ticket as well as airfare and a room, since I currently only work part
time as an intern with [Geni](http://geni.com). I could have submitted a talk,
but I decided against it so that I could focus on things other than slideshows
for a while.

But hey, I should have known that wasn't the end of it. When has the Clojure
community ever let me miss out on something? Never is when. This time is
certainly no different. I wandered into my email account about a week ago and
there sat an email from Lynn Grogan. She was asking if I was going to the
Conj. She said that "at least one person wants to donate their ticket to
you". As spectacularly impossible and amazing this was, I had to email her back
saying that I still wouldn't be able to cover airfare and a hotel room on such
short notice.

Less than 30 seconds later, good ol' Chas Emerick pings me on IRC and we start
jotting out how I can get there. I came to learn that my good friend Carin Meier
(an avid 4Clojure contributor and all around good person) was the person who was
donating her ticket. Unfortunately she is unable to go to the Conj this year and
didn't want her ticket to go to waste. She thought of me! Everybody give her a
round of applause!

So Chas and I discussed things for a while and we decided that I should follow
in
[Laurent Petit](http://code.google.com/p/counterclockwise/wiki/ConjTripFunding)'s
footsteps and hold a fundraiser of my own. If you've been around Clojure for a
couple of years (or at least read hacker news), you will probably remember that
this isn't the first time the Clojure community has helped me exceed my own
limitations and do something great. In fact, my first plane ride was on a
[community funded trip to the first Conj when I was 16](http://cemerick.com/2010/09/10/a-clojure-scholarship-lets-send-raynes-to-the-conj/). Needless
to say, those were some of the most memorable and amazing days of my life.

In summary, I only found out a few days ago that I now have a free ticket to the
conj. I had no intentions of going so I have no money at all saved up for the
trip. Even more problematic is that plane tickets are now higher than
usual. Here is what I'm looking at:

* Hotel room at the conference booked from the 14th to the 18th of November at
  $134 a night: $536
* Airfare roundtrip from Birmingham, AL to Raleigh, NC at $368: $368
* I'm going to raise the ceiling a bit to help cover a ticket for my mother (who
  really enjoys these trips), food and drink, and a little emergency money just
  in case. $400
  
Grand total: $1304. I have set the goal to an even $1300.

Your next question may very well be "Who the hell are you and why should I
donate?". My name is Anthony Grimes. I've been around the Clojure community
since I was around 15 years old and have developed a close relationship with its
members because of it. I am the author of numerous projects, including some
well-known ones such as

* [TryClojure](http://tryclj.com), a sandboxed online REPL + mini tutorial for
  new Clojurians.
* [Refheap](https://www.refheap.com), a pastebin written in Clojure that aspires
  to exceed the standard set by gist, with a focus on usability for Clojure
  users.
* [Clojail](https://github.com/flatland/clojail), a Clojure sandboxing library
  that powers 4Clojure and TryClojure.
* [lazybot](https://github.com/flatland/lazybot), an IRC bot written in Clojure
  with Clojure evaluation and a host of other features. It is no doubt the best
  bot evars.
  
You can see the rest of my projects and activity on
[github](https://github.com/Raynes).

In addition to my own projects, I am an avid proponent and contributor to

* The [leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) build tool, having
  contributed some built-in commands and numerous plugins, including
  [lein-newnew](https://github.com/Raynes/lein-newnew)
* [4Clojure](http://4clojure.com), an excellent learning tool for Clojure
  developers that poses problems and asks you for solutions.
* The [flatland organization](https://github.com/flatland), a whole host of
  libraries and tools written by a group of friends and colleagues at Geni.
  
I
[spoke about clojail](http://blip.tv/clojure/anthony-grimes-clojail-life-in-the-clojure-prison-5919720)
at last year's Conj.
  
At this point in time, I am 18 years old and I live in a small town in Alabama
called Eldridge.

So that's me and this is my appeal. This trip would be an excellent opportunity
to me to learn about and experience new things as well as keep in touch with the
community and discuss projects/ideas. Any donations are appreciated and if you
leave your name with your donation I will list it in a follow-up blog post and
personally dance for you at the Conj<sup>1</sup>.

Paypal doesn't really have anything in the way of progress bars and the like, so
I'm going to update this blog post manually. Don't expect the total to rise
immediately after you donate. Also keep in mind that the paypal account is my
mother's (I don't have a personal account because I rarely use paypal), so the
name listed is Connie Simpson.
