It isn't much of a secret that I'm writing a book on Clojure,
tentatively titled 'Meet Clojure'. I've talked about it on twitter and
IRC. People have been asking me about my focuses and such for the book
as well as other important details, so instead of repeating myself for
each question, I'll explain the book, the purpose of the book and all of
that noise here.
## Niche

Freeness. There aren't many free online resources for new Clojure
developers. This book's electronic version will be licensed under a
Creative Commons license and be made freely available. In addition the
source of the book will be available on Github at some point in time.
## Focus

Beginners to Clojure. I want my book to be the logical step backwards
from The Joy of Clojure. It's a whirlwind tour of Clojure designed to
teach Clojure to a beginner and get them up and running with their own
project, a build tool, and other important things. It isn't designed to
teach the nooks and crannies of Clojure or to go really in-depth about
things. The Joy of Clojure does this well, so I don't need to. My book
will be a comprehensive introduction and tutorial to the language. By
the end of the book, readers should be writing their own code and be
thirsty for Clojure. Also important is the tone of the book. I'm writing
the book in a spirit very similar to Learn You a Haskell. My book is
meant to be very lighthearted and easy to read. It's amusing and
humorous, but not weird to the extent of \_why's Poignant Guide to Ruby.
## Audience

Everybody.
## Title

The working title 'Meet Clojure' may change. People seem to like it, as
unclever as it is. I'd like for the book to have an amusing or clever
name, and somebody recommended 'sexpbook' which seems to qualify. I'm
leaning towards the final title being "Meet Clojure: The Sexpbook", but
nothing is set in stoned and I'm still taking suggestions.
## Process

I'm writing the book in pandoc's extended version of markdown. I'm
letting pandoc compile the markdown source to latex and then letting
xelatex compile the latex to a PDF. I'm writing the book in Emacs using
markdown-mode. When the book is finished, I'm going to conspire with a
friend to get a good looking HTML version of the book (which pandoc can
handle the hardest part of doing) up and running. The book will be open
source, so formats that people want that I don't provide can happen. I
have no release date. I've got a lot of the book already written, but
there is plenty more to do. I expect it finished in less than 3 months.
No promises, because life throws curve balls.
## Review

A lot of people I know have been given access to my drafts and a lot of
people, including Clojurians, have their eyes all over this book and
thus are helping me with technical portions of the book. One friend has
pointed out that he isn't opposed to copy-editing the book for me, so
I'm doing okay in the review department.
## Publishing

I don't know whether this book will ever be published. This book was a
random idea that grew into something big. I had already written 50 pages
before publishing ever even came to mind. I don't know whether or not
this book will get published or if I'll even try to get it published. I
may send it to some publishers upon completion, and I may just
self-publish it. I may do nothing at all and just provide online copies
with a humble little donate button beside them. I'd like to make a
little money off of this book, and God knows I could use it, but the
world of publishing is very new to me, so I have no idea how any of this
will work out. *Update: I'm currently talking with No Starch about
possibly publishing this thing. Fingers crosses.*
## Conclusion

I'm not stingy with my book. It's going to be open source and free
anyway, so I don't mind giving drafts to people who ask and are
interested. If you're a Clojurian interested in reviewing the book or
similar, you can contact me via email or twitter. My email address is
i@this website's base domain. You can reach me on twitter @IORayne. I
hope that, when this book is done, everybody has as much fun reading it
as I did writing it. -Anthony
