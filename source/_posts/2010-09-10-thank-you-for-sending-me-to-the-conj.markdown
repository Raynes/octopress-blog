Today, [Chas Emerick](http://cemerick.com) held a [fund
raiser](http://cemerick.com/2010/09/10/a-clojure-scholarship-lets-send-raynes-to-the-conj/)
trying to raise 1 thousand dollars to fund a trip from Alabama to Durham
NC for the first ever [Clojure Conj](http://first.clojure-conj.org/)
conference. In the space of 72 minutes, [we reached (and slightly
exceeded) our
goal](http://cemerick.com/2010/09/10/anthony-simpson-will-receive-his-clojure-scholarship-thanks-to-you/)
of $1,000 dollars. I can't even begin to describe how I feel right now.
I feel like I am a member of the most awesome community for any
programming language. I owe the Clojure community more than I could ever
repay. I cannot thank you guys enough for this. This means more to me
than any gift I've ever received. I'd like to thank
[Relevance](http://thinkrelevance.com/) for so willingly agreeing to
waive the admission fee to the conference itself, and for agreeing to
pay for a relative and I's stay at the hotel. Without their support,
this trip would not be possible. I'd also like to thank Chas Emerick
(cemerick), because he is the person who made all of this happen. He
took an interest in a random small-town teenager when he didn't have any
obligation to. He's the one who spoke to the guys at Relevance, and the
one who came up with the idea of a fund raiser and made all of this
happen. I might have to start calling you dad. Most of all, I'd like to
thank the Clojure community and everybody who donated. [Some
people](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1679627) who don't even use
Clojure donated totally out of the kindness of their hearts, and for
that, I thank you. I think it says a lot of the Clojure community that,
in the space of 72 minutes, they can manage to raise 1 thousand dollars
for somebody they don't even know. You've all given me a gift that
extends far beyond trip itself. You've let me know that you guys are
there for me, and that you do value me as a member of the community. I
will never be able to thank you enough. -Anthony Simpson
